# Pokédex Application - User Stories

## User Story 1: User Authentication

**Role**: As an administrator
**Complexity**: 3 (Fibonacci)

**Brief Description**:
Implement a secure login system that validates administrator credentials and maintains authenticated session state.

**Given-When-Then**:
- **Given** I am an unauthenticated user on the login page
- **When** I enter username "admin" and password "admin" and submit the form
- **Then** I should be authenticated and redirected to the home page with my session persisted

**Given-When-Then** (Invalid Credentials):
- **Given** I am on the login page
- **When** I enter invalid credentials
- **Then** I should see an error message and remain on the login page

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Login form must have username and password fields with proper validation
2. Only "admin/admin" credentials should be accepted
3. Invalid credentials should display a clear error message
4. Successful login should persist authentication state (localStorage/cookies)
5. Form should validate required fields before submission
6. Password field should mask input characters

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Login form UI is implemented with proper styling
- [ ] Client-side validation is in place
- [ ] Backend POST /login endpoint validates credentials
- [ ] Authentication state is persisted in browser storage
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and clear
- [ ] Unit tests cover validation logic
- [ ] JSDoc documentation is complete

## User Story 2: Protected Routes and Navigation

**Role**: As a system
**Complexity**: 2 (Fibonacci)

**Brief Description**:

- **Then** I should be automatically redirected to the home page

**Given-When-Then** (Unauthenticated User):
- **Given** I am not authenticated
- **When** I try to access the home page or detail pages
- **Then** I should be redirected to the login page

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Authentication middleware checks session state on every protected route
2. Unauthenticated users cannot access home or detail pages
3. Authenticated users are redirected away from login page
4. Route protection works on page refresh
5. Navigation is seamless without flickering

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Route protection middleware is implemented
- [ ] All protected routes are secured
- [ ] Redirects work correctly in all scenarios
- [ ] Session persistence works across page refreshes
- [ ] Unit tests cover route protection logic
- [ ] JSDoc documentation is complete

**Given-When-Then** (Pagination):
- **Given** I am viewing a page of Pokémon
- **When** I click on the next/previous page controls
- **Then** I should see the next/previous set of Pokémon

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Display Pokémon with image, name, and number
2. Implement pagination controls (next, previous, page numbers)
3. Each page shows a consistent number of Pokémon
4. Loading states are displayed while fetching data
5. Error states are handled gracefully
6. Images load efficiently with proper fallbacks

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Pokémon list displays correctly with all required information

## User Story 4: Search and Sort Pokémon

**Role**: As a Pokémon enthusiast
**Complexity**: 5 (Fibonacci)

**Brief Description**:
Enable users to search for specific Pokémon and sort the list by name or number.

**Given-When-Then** (Search):
- **Given** I am on the home page
- **When** I enter a Pokémon name in the search bar
- **Then** the list should filter to show matching Pokémon

**Given-When-Then** (Sort):
- **Given** I am viewing the Pokémon list
- **When** I select to sort by name or number
- **Then** the list should reorder accordingly

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Search bar filters Pokémon in real-time or on submit
2. Search works with partial matches
3. Sort options include: name (A-Z), name (Z-A), number (ascending), number (descending)
4. Search and sort can work together
5. Clear search button resets the filter
6. Empty search results display appropriate message
